# N-Tier

![N-Tier!](/images/n-tier.png)

- Each layer has specific functionality
- A higher layer like Web Tier can use services of lower layer like middle layer, but not the other way
- Tiers are physically seperated, running on different machines.
- Physically seperating tier improves scalability and resilence but adds latency.
