### Subnet 
An IP subnet is simply a subset of a Class A, B, or C network. 
In fact, the word subnet is a shortened version of the phrase *subdivided network*.

### Analyze Subnetting and Addressing Needs

- Which hosts should be grouped together into a subnet?
- How many subnets does this internetwork require?
- How many host IP addresses does each subnet require?
- Will we use a single subnet size for simplicity, or not?
